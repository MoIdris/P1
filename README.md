# Sales and Operation Planning Project
*In this project, you are going to simulate a sales and operations planning using the zero-stock
 level strategy. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the following data:
* An initial stock level for a product
* The number of month(s) to plan
* The planned sales quantity for each month
* Based on this data, calculate the required production quantity as follows:
* If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production
 quantity is 0
* If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity
 is this difference
